The dataset consists of five cabins, each described by features like size, sauna size, distance to water, number of indoor bathrooms, and proximity to neighbors.

    "This example demonstrates the power of the least squares method in fitting linear regression models. As the dataset expands, the model adapts to account for additional variation in the data, leading to updated predictions and coefficient estimates. This showcases how linear regression provides a flexible framework for predictive modeling, even as the number of data points or features changes.\n",

    "- The least squares method can perfectly fit a model when the number of features matches the number of observations.\n",

    "- When more data is added, the model adjusts, leading to more nuanced predictions that account for the new information.\n",
